# Loan Default Prediction App Project
In this case study, we are given a Loan Default dataset that contains 31 columns and 888,000 rows. 
The objective of this project is to predict the target variable; “Loan_No_Loan” which contains 1(Loan) and 0(No Loan).
This simply means that given the parameters in the train dataset,we should be able to predict whether the customer 
should be given a loan or not.

-Also included are PowerBi Visualizations of the data, as well as an SQL script to querry the original DB
